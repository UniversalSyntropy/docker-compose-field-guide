# Docker Compose Field Guide

A reference for building Docker Compose stacks that are well-structured, security-hardened, and straightforward to maintain. Aimed at homelabs and self-hosted setups.

> **Requires:** Docker Engine 24+ with Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose` plugin).
>
> **Scope:** Homelab / self-hosted / LAN-facing services.
> If you're exposing services to the internet, this is a reasonable starting point — but you'll also need a reverse proxy with TLS, rate limiting, and stricter network policies.
> See the [threat model note](docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md#3-security-hardening).

## Who this is for

- You run a homelab, NAS, Pi, or small server
- You know basic Linux and have run at least one container before
- You want to do things properly — security, backups, log rotation — without reading the CIS Benchmark end-to-end
- You're tired of Compose files cobbled together from Stack Overflow snippets

---

## What this is not

- A beginner tutorial — if you've never used Docker, start with [DOCKER-BASICS.md](docs/DOCKER-BASICS.md)
- A guide for large-scale production, Kubernetes, or Swarm deployments
- A drop-in solution — you'll need to adapt the template to your services

---

## What's included

- **An annotated [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) template** — copy it into your project. Includes security defaults, log rotation, resource limits, and healthchecks as a starting baseline.
- **[21 sections of best practices](docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md)** — from [network trust zones](docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md#72-network-isolation-by-trust-zone) and [secrets management](docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md#36-secrets-management)
  to [USB passthrough](docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md#16-usb-and-hardware-devices) and [cross-platform gotchas](docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md#15-cross-platform-compatibility). The WSL2/NTFS warning alone will save you hours.
- **[A troubleshooting guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** — step-by-step [debugging playbook](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#2-debugging-playbook),
  [decision tree](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#6-troubleshooting-decision-tree), and fixes for orphan containers, port conflicts, and data that "disappears" after a recreate.
- **[A monitoring stack](monitoring/)** — Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter, and cAdvisor. A reference config you'll want to adapt to your setup (Node Exporter gives meaningful host metrics on Linux only).
- **[Hardened recipes](recipes/)** — ready-to-deploy templates for [Pi-hole](recipes/pihole.yml), [Nextcloud](recipes/nextcloud.yml), and [Traefik](recipes/traefik.yml) with security exceptions documented inline.
- **[Reverse proxy & HTTPS guide](docs/REVERSE-PROXY.md)** — how to put Traefik in front of your services with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates.
- **[Advanced secrets management](docs/SECRETS-MANAGEMENT.md)** — graduating from plain-text secrets to SOPS, Doppler, or git-crypt.
- **[Helper scripts](scripts/)** — safe resets, hard resets, disk reports, and pruning. So you don't have to remember the flags.
- **[Glossary](docs/GLOSSARY.md) and [index](docs/INDEX.md)** — look up any term, or find where a topic is discussed across the docs.
- **[AI agent instructions](docs/AGENT-SETUP.md)** — for Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, and Cursor, so your coding tools follow the same standards you do.

## Quick start

### Try the quickstart stack

A ready-to-run stack with a dashboard and monitoring tool that demonstrates
every pattern in this guide:

```bash
cd quickstart
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
# Dashboard: http://localhost:3000   Monitoring: http://localhost:3001
```

See [quickstart/README.md](quickstart/README.md) for setup details.

### Use the template in your own project

```bash
# 1. Copy the template into your project
cp docker-compose.yml ~/my-project/docker-compose.yml
cp .env.example ~/my-project/.env

# 2. Create secrets (never committed to git)
mkdir -p ~/my-project/secrets
echo -n "your-password" > ~/my-project/secrets/db_password.txt

# 3. Validate before deploying
cd ~/my-project
docker compose config --quiet

# 4. Deploy
docker compose up -d

# 5. Verify
docker compose ps
```

> The template is a **starting point**, not a drop-in solution. You'll need to swap in your own images, volumes, and secrets. The annotations explain what each block does and why.

## Architecture

How a hardened homelab stack fits together — from the user's browser down
to isolated containers and read-only volumes:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    User([User / Browser])
    User -->|HTTPS 443| Proxy

    subgraph docker [Docker Host]
        Proxy[Reverse Proxy<br/>Traefik / Caddy]

        subgraph frontend [Frontend Network]
            App1[App Container<br/>e.g. Nextcloud]
            App2[App Container<br/>e.g. Grafana]
        end

        subgraph backend [Backend Network — no external access]
            DB[(Database<br/>Postgres / MariaDB)]
            Cache[(Cache<br/>Redis)]
        end

        subgraph storage [Volumes & Secrets]
            Vols[Bind Mounts<br/>read-only where possible]
            Secrets[/run/secrets/*<br/>file-based, never in .env]
        end

        Proxy -->|HTTP internal| App1
        Proxy -->|HTTP internal| App2
        App1 --> DB
        App1 --> Cache
        App2 --> DB
        DB --- Vols
        DB --- Secrets
        App1 --- Vols
    end

    style Proxy fill:#4a9eff,color:#fff
    style DB fill:#e67e22,color:#fff
    style Cache fill:#e67e22,color:#fff
    style App1 fill:#2ecc71,color:#fff
    style App2 fill:#2ecc71,color:#fff
    style Secrets fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style backend fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#e67e22
    style frontend fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2ecc71
```

Each container runs with `cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, resource
limits, and log rotation. Networks isolate trust zones — the database is
never reachable from the internet, and secrets are mounted as files, not
passed as environment variables.

## What hardening looks like

A naive Compose service vs the same service with this guide's defaults applied:

<details>
<summary><strong>Before — common but fragile</strong></summary>

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
    restart: always
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>After — hardened baseline</strong></summary>

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:1.27.4                    # Pin to exact version
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true             # Block privilege escalation
    cap_drop: [ALL]                        # Drop all capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE                   # Only what's needed for port 80
    read_only: true                        # Immutable root filesystem
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
      - /var/cache/nginx
      - /run
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro    # Read-only bind mount
    mem_limit: 128m                        # Prevent OOM killing neighbours
    cpus: 0.5                              # Prevent CPU starvation
    pids_limit: 100                        # Prevent fork bombs
    restart: unless-stopped                # Respect manual stops
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options: { max-size: "10m", max-file: "3" }
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:80/"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
    networks:
      - frontend
```

</details>

Every directive is explained in the [best practices](docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md).
The [annotated template](docker-compose.yml) is a copy-paste starting point.

## Helper scripts

```bash
# Restart a stack without losing data
./scripts/safe-reset.sh [path/to/docker-compose.yml]

# Full teardown + rebuild (WARNING: deletes volumes)
./scripts/hard-reset.sh [path/to/docker-compose.yml]

# See what Docker is using on disk
./scripts/docker-disk-report.sh

# Remove unused resources (stopped containers, dangling images, etc.)
./scripts/prune-unused.sh              # Safe mode
./scripts/prune-unused.sh --aggressive # Also removes all unused images + volumes
```

## Security approach

This guide follows the [CIS Docker Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker) and [OWASP Docker Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) as baselines. The defaults are:

- Drop all Linux capabilities, add back only what's needed
- Block privilege escalation (`no-new-privileges`)
- Run as non-root where the image supports it
- Use Docker secrets for passwords (not environment variables)
- Read-only root filesystem where possible

These are **safe defaults for a homelab LAN**. They reduce your attack surface and catch common mistakes.
They are not a complete security architecture — if you're exposing services to the internet, you'll need more (reverse proxy, TLS, WAF, network policies).
The [security hardening section](docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md#3-security-hardening) explains each control, when to relax it, and how to document exceptions.

---

## Trust and limits

This guide is:

- A **hardened starting point** for homelab and self-hosted stacks
- Based on published standards (CIS Docker Benchmark, OWASP Docker Security)
- Tested with Docker Engine 24+ and Compose v2 on Linux, macOS, and Windows/WSL2

This guide is **not**:

- A substitute for a security audit
- Validated for internet-facing production without additional controls (reverse proxy, TLS, WAF)
- A guarantee — Docker, Compose, and upstream images change; verify against your environment
- Maintained by a security team — it is a community reference

If you find an error or a gap, [open an issue](https://github.com/UniversalSyntropy/docker-compose-field-guide/issues).

---

## Standards

- [CIS Docker Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker) — container isolation, resource limits, capabilities
- [OWASP Docker Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) — secrets, images, networking
- [Docker Compose specification](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/) — authoritative reference for all directives

---

## Troubleshooting quick fixes

### Service can't connect to another service

**Likely cause:** Using `localhost` instead of the service name. Inside a Compose network, `localhost` means the container itself.

**Fix:** Use the service name as the hostname (e.g., `database:5432`, not `localhost:5432`).

### Data disappeared after restart

**Likely cause:** Data was stored in the container filesystem or an anonymous volume, or `down -v` deleted named volumes.

**Fix:** Use explicit named volumes or bind mounts for all persistent data. Restore from backup if available.

### Port conflict ("address already in use")

**Likely cause:** Another container or host process is using the port.

**Fix:**

```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}"
docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker compose up -d
```
